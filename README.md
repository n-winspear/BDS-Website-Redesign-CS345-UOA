# Book Discussion Scheme Website Redesign

### Description
This project was built as a part of my COMPSCI345 course at the University of Auckland.

The course centers around the UI/UX design of modern websites and applications. This projects brief was to review the current website of the Book Discussion Scheme website and design an updated version of the site that includes all the current functionality from a front-end point of view.
